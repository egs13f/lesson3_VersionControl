            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As a developer, designer, or other knowledge worker is producing and editing a file, it becomes an intricate process to save various versions of the file as it is being altered. The most common method of organizing these files are to simply save file after file with only minor differences between them. This is a simple method, yet the result is often confusing and counter-productive. Version control is a method of file sharing that creates one main repository for all of the project files, ultimately making it easier and more productive to collaborate and experiment without detrimental results.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system tracks changes as they occur, as well as the user that made the changes. It is a system completely based on the revision history of each file, as well as merging the changes to the same file. This allows a simple flow of communication, while not interfering with the work itself, making collaboration more efficient. Version control systems do not allow files to be overwritten and users can even work on the same file simultaneously without any conflict. This allows the files to be consistently backed up to completely avoid losing work or having to start a project from the beginning.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is the place in which the changing files are stored. They are created so that developers can record the history of their files and track both the status and the various versions of the files. There are two types of repositories. The first is a remote repository, which is shared among team members and is used as the base of a project. The second is a local repository, which is individualized to each machine or user. An individual can create a local repository by simply creating a brand new repository, or by copying an existing remote repository and using it on a single machine.

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created as a version control system specifically designed for maximum efficiency in both small projects and large projects. The program was originally designed for the Linux kernel project, which was massive. The project originally relied on Bitkeeper, which is a DVCS that revoked its free-of-charge status, which prompted Linux to create their own tool. The goal was to keep the same characteristics, such as speed, simplicity, strong support, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects. Since its creation in 2005, it has managed to keep those characteristics, as well as matured in ways that allow users to collaborate and work in the most efficient environment possible.

                <span class="text-muted">Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Git file can be in one of three states: committed, modified, and staged. In the committed stage, the data is safely stored in the database on an individual machine or username. The modified stage indicates that the file has been changed but not yet committed to a local database. The staged state is a modified file that is in its current version that goes in as the most recent commit snapshot. The main sections of a Git project are the directory, which stores the metadata and is the most important part, the working directory, where one version of the file exists, and the staging area, which stores information about what the next commit will contain.
